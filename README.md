Originally This code was for the server for a tiny house app. I am no longer doing that becuase I have another project I want to do first. I am keeping all of this code as it can be reused and I like how I built this server. It'll probably be awile before I work on it as my new project involves a lot of python and I want to master the langauge before continuing.
